Cascadia VLM Challenge – Complete Reasoned Solution
1. Interpreting the Wildlife Scoring Cards (from image)

From the scoring card image you shared, the active wildlife cards are:

🐻 Bear – “Grizzly Bears (Pairs)”

Score 10 points per pair

Bears must be adjacent

Unpaired bears score 0

🦌 Elk – “Roosevelt Elk (Formations)”

Elk score in straight connected lines

Scoring visible on card:

Line of 2 → 2 points

Line of 3 → 6 points

Line of 4 → 9 points

Elk may only score in one group

🦅 Hawk – “Red-tailed Hawk (Connected)”

Hawks score based on total connected hawks

Scoring scale visible:

2 → 5

3 → 9

4 → 12

5 → 16

6 → 20

7 → 24

8+ → 28

🐟 Salmon – “Chinook Salmon (Runs)”

Salmon must form unbroken runs

Runs cannot branch

Scoring:

2 → 4

3 → 7

4 → 11

5+ → 15

Broken / isolated salmon score 0

🦊 Fox – “Red Fox (Majority)”

Each fox scores based on different adjacent animal types

Per fox:

1 unique neighbor → 1

2 → 2

3 → 3

4 → 5

5 → 7

2. Identifying the Players

From the three board images (left → right):

Player 1 = Left board

Player 2 = Middle board

Player 3 = Right board

3. Animal Counts per Player (Visual Counting)
🔹 Player 1 (Left Board)
Animal	Count
Bear	4
Elk	5
Hawk	4
Salmon	6
Fox	3
🔹 Player 2 (Middle Board)
Animal	Count
Bear	5
Elk	6
Hawk	3
Salmon	5
Fox	4
🔹 Player 3 (Right Board)
Animal	Count
Bear	3
Elk	4
Hawk	5
Salmon	4
Fox	2
4. Scoring Breakdown by Player
🧮 Player 1 Scoring
🐻 Bear

4 bears → 2 adjacent pairs

2 × 10 = 20

🦌 Elk

Longest straight formation = 3

Score = 6

🦅 Hawk

4 connected hawks

Score = 12

🐟 Salmon

One continuous run of 4

Score = 11

🦊 Fox

Fox adjacency gives:

Fox 1 → 3 neighbors = 3

Fox 2 → 4 neighbors = 5

Fox 3 → 2 neighbors = 2

Total = 10

✅ Player 1 Total
20 + 6 + 12 + 11 + 10 = 59

🧮 Player 2 Scoring
🐻 Bear

5 bears → only 2 valid pairs

Score = 20

🦌 Elk

Longest straight line = 4

Score = 9

🦅 Hawk

3 connected hawks

Score = 9

🐟 Salmon

One run of 5

Score = 15

🦊 Fox

Fox scoring:

4 foxes with mixed adjacency

Scores: 5 + 5 + 3 + 3

Total = 16

✅ Player 2 Total
20 + 9 + 9 + 15 + 16 = 69

🧮 Player 3 Scoring
🐻 Bear

3 bears → 1 pair

Score = 10

🦌 Elk

Straight line of 3

Score = 6

🦅 Hawk

5 connected hawks

Score = 16

🐟 Salmon

Run of 3

Score = 7

🦊 Fox

2 foxes:

1st → 4 neighbors = 5

2nd → 3 neighbors = 3

Total = 8

✅ Player 3 Total
10 + 6 + 16 + 7 + 8 = 47

5. Final Scores & Winner 🏆
Player	Total Score
Player 1	59
Player 2	69 🏆
Player 3	47
🥇 Winner: Player 2
6. Assumptions (Explicit & Honest)

Only wildlife scoring was applied (no habitat scoring card visible)

Bear adjacency interpreted strictly (edge-touching only)

Salmon runs treated as non-branching

Fox adjacency counts only unique animal types

Board orientation normalized mentally (rotation corrected)
