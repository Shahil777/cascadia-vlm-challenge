Vision–Language Model challenge solution for Cascadia board game scoring. Includes visual reasoning, rule-based wildlife scoring, reproducible analysis, and clear winner determination.
Title: Cascadia Vision–Language Model (VLM) Challenge – Phronetic AI

Description:

This repository contains my submission for the Vision–Language Model (VLM) Challenge as part of the Machine Learning Scientist hiring process at Phronetic AI.

The objective of this challenge is to evaluate whether a Vision–Language reasoning system can accurately interpret the final state of a completed Cascadia board game from images and correctly compute final scores using the official wildlife scoring rules.

Using only the provided board images and wildlife scoring cards, this work demonstrates:

Visual interpretation of multi-player board states

Identification and counting of wildlife tokens per player

Extraction and application of official Cascadia wildlife scoring rules

Transparent, rule-based score computation

Final score comparison and winner determination

The repository includes:

Input images (final player boards and scoring cards)

A reproducible Google Colab notebook with step-by-step reasoning

Clear documentation of assumptions and scoring logic

Final score breakdowns for all players

The focus of this submission is correctness, interpretability, and reproducibility, rather than UI or automation.
